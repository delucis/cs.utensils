# Contributing to `cs.utensils`

Oh, wow! Hi!

`cs.utensils` is mainly a place for keeping small abstractions I find personally helpful.
But if you think something is missing, have spotted a bug, or would like to propose some changes,
excellent! Thank you! Anyone and everyone is welcome, just please note [the code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## :bug: Yowza, this is broken! :bug:

If you found a bug I lovingly coaxed from its chrysalis, please gently liberate it via the nearest window. :open_hands:

You can either:
- [post an issue](https://github.com/delucis/cs.utensils/issues/new), letting me know the bug exists; _or_
- open a pull request, proposing changes that will fix the bug.

## :sparkles: Shiny doodads €1 :sparkles:

If you have a brand new helpful Max thingie and would like to put it in this drawer with the other utensils. Sure! Why not?

1. Create your own fork of this repository
2. Create a branch for your shiny new doodad, e.g. called `shiny-new-doodad`
3. Commit your changes to your branch
4. Open a pull request
5. Drink that carrot juice you’ve been saving for a special moment. :rabbit: :tada:


### Wait, aren’t there any rules? :cop:

No, not really? Be kind to one another?

Oh! And if you’re adding a new abstraction, please also add a helpfile with a `.maxhelp` extension to the `help` directory and reference documentation with a `.maxref.xml` extension to the `docs` directory. That way future humans (and others?!) will be able to figure out what your thingamajig does.

If you don’t know how to create those, DO NOT FEAR! Open a pull request regardless and we can work on it together. :two_hearts:
